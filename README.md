This is my first project, inspired by the youtuber and streamer MiduDev🎥, who featured this classic retro game in his extensive project of [100 JavaScript activities](https://www.javascript100.dev/) for practice. To wanted to go further with the development of the game, so I added multiple levels, lives, a scoring system, pause functionality, game-over and win screens, as well as sound effects. Additionally, I redesigned the theme to give it a fresh look 🎨.
